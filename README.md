Smart Contracts Development Challenge
(Blockchain):
Challenge Description:
Your task is to develop a smart contract on a testnet (e.g., Sepolia) that enforces a unique
ownership rule. The smart contract should create an ERC1155 token where wallet owners
can possess one of the main token of the smart contract, and this main token is soulbound.
Additionally, create many item tokens that can only be transacted between wallets that
possess the soulbound main token. To better understand you can consider a game context
where the main token represents a character, and item tokens are accessories or items
related to the character. Your solution should demonstrate a understanding of blockchain
development and token standards.
Requirements:
1. Develop an ERC1155 smart contract on a testnet (e.g., Sepolia).
2. Implement logic that allows each wallet to own only one soulbound main token.
3. Design item tokens that can only be transacted between wallets with the soulbound
main token.
4. Provide thorough documentation on the contract&#39;s functionality, deployment, and
usage.
